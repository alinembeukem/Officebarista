# Officebarista general description
During the Wintersemester 2017/2018 at the Reutlingen University we developed a MVP to order Coffee and manage the accounting via Google Home from the Siemens EQ.9 coffee machine.



The idea behind the development is that a coffee order from the workplace is possible. For this, the user has three options:
Either he uses the app developed for this, or he orders via Google Home, which must be centrally located in the office.
Should he order via Google Home, user identification and billing will be done via the language. If he orders via the app, 
the identification is done via the stored password. In the third case, he can order coffee as usual with his RFID card directly on the device.
In both cases I can access all the standard coffees of the "Siemens TI909701HC EQ.9 connect s900 coffee machine". The forwarding of the commands takes place via IFTTT.
Since the consumption of milk and coffee beans is recorded and tracked, an automatic reordering of consumables is provided. The collection takes place via Wunderlist 
and the final order is processed via Amazon.
